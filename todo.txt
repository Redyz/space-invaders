-Unify logic.notify to use a message system over an entity pointer
-Add boundaries to the game area so that it doesn't go multiline
-Fix the weird refreshing bug
-Add nice equal, multi-line splitting of ghosts + centered
--Maybe fix the 'exiting game' message that does not display in main.cpp:32
-Remove cursor display after drawing text (the [] after drawing the main character)
-The ::draw() methods in windows.cpp are not fully portable, would be better to have something like draw(entity) or something along those lines)
-There is a segfault upon deletion of the walls - might want to check into that (deletion/collision is probably not done correctly)
