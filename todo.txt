-Unify logic.notify to use a message system over an entity pointer
-Add boundaries to the game area so that it doesn't go multiline
-Fix the weird refreshing bug
-Add nice equal, multi-line splitting of ghosts + centered
--Maybe fix the 'exiting game' message that does not display in main.cpp:32
-The ::draw() methods in windows.cpp are not fully portable, would be better to have something like draw(entity) or something along those lines)
-Figure out how to do menus:
--What about menu::step()
--And view menuDisplay()? VisualMenu::display(); / VisualMenu::step();
--- get latest menu state & display it
--- get input
--- process input & send to logic::menu
-Is it possible/logical to impose a max width even when using SFML?
--Things such as wall need to be based on ncurses but shouldn't... hm
